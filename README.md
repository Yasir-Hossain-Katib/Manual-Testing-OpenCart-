# Project Overview
OpenCart is an open-source eCommerce platform that allows businesses to create an online store. This project involved manually testing various functionalities of OpenCart to ensure they meet the specified requirements.

# Testing Approach
Manual Testing: All tests were conducted manually to validate the behavior of OpenCart’s features against its functional requirements.
Requirements Coverage: Each requirement listed in the FRS was mapped to specific test cases, ensuring full coverage of the system’s functionality.
Bug Reporting: Any discrepancies between expected and actual results were documented in the bug report, which is also included in this repository.  

# Test Types
The following types of testing were carried out:

Functional Testing: Verifying that all functions of OpenCart work according to the requirements.
Usability Testing: Ensuring that the system is user-friendly and that the user interface is intuitive.
Boundary Testing: Testing the system with edge-case data to ensure robustness.
